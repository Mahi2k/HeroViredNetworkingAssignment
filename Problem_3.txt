10. Now as per assignmnet we need to install nginx and host a website, for the sake of time I hosted default website
11. 1# Update apt package manager
	> sudo apt-get update

    2# Install NGINX in the system

            listen 80;
            root /var/www/html/awesomevicky.com;
            index index.html index.htm;
            server_name awesomevicky.com;
            location / {
                    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
