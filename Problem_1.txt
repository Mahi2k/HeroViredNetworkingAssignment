Question 1 : For 10 Points
Deploy a website on localhost using either apache2 or nginx. Create a DNS name for this website as ‘awesomevicky.com’. You can use any web template you want or can write your own simple html code. Write a detailed documentation with steps involved.

# STEPS #
 
1# Update apt package manager
	> sudo apt-get update

2# Install NGINX in the system
	> sudo apt-get install nginx

3# Check the default configuration of NGINX (it should be inside /etc/nginx/sites-available/).   
  Check the text inside deafult config file by triggering the command
	> sudo cat deafult

4# Create a config file for awesomevicky.com use command
	> cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
	> sudo nano awesomevicky.com

	# Paste below config settings inside the file
	server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/html/awesomevicky.com;
        index index.html index.htm;
        server_name awesomevicky.com;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }

5# Create a symbolic link for this config file from sites-available to sites-enabled folder by using the command
	> ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/awesomevicky.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

6# Till now we have created a config for the domain name now we need to create a website with the same folder name and index.html file inside it
	> cd /var/www/html
	> sudo mkdir awesomevicky.com
    > sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/awesomevicky.com #This provides permission to read and write the files in folder
	> cd awesomevicky.com/
	> sudo nano index.html
	
7# Add below html code in index.html file and save it
	<html>
        <head>
	        <title>AWESOME VICKY SERVER</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <section>
                <h1>Welcome to Environment NGNIX SERVER</h1>
                <p>This is the first example for creating NGINX SERVER</p>
            </section>
        </body>
    </html>

8# Restart the nginx server
    > sudo systemctl restart nginx

9# Still website with domain name will not work since we have not added a DNS entry
    # In windows we have to add an entry in the host file for redirecting the website domain to localhost web server. It is present inside "c:/windows/system32/driver/etc/"
    > Add entry as below 
        127.0.0.1	awesomevicky.com
        ::1         awesomevicky.com

10# After saving this file go to chrome and hit the domain "awesomevicky.com"

11# Voila..!! Website is working.
