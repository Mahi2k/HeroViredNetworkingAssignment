Question 2 : For 10 Points
A website can have many subdomains and different services are running on them. Write a Python script to check the status of the subdomains which are up or down. The script should automatically check the status every min and should update it in tabular format on the screen. Write a detailed documentation of it. 

# STEPS #

1# Update apt package manager
	> sudo apt-get update

2# Install NGINX in the system
	> sudo apt-get install nginx

3# Check the default configuration of NGINX (it should be inside /etc/nginx/sites-available/).   
  Check the text inside deafult config file by triggering the command
	> sudo cat deafult

4# Create a config file for awesomevicky.com use command
	> cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
	> sudo nano awesomevicky.com

	# Paste below config settings inside the file
	server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/html/awesomevicky.com;
        index index.html index.htm;
        server_name awesomevicky.com;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }

5# Create a symbolic link for this config file from sites-available to sites-enabled folder by using the command
	> ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/awesomevicky.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

6# Till now we have created a config for the domain name now we need to create a website with the same folder name and index.html file inside it
	> cd /var/www/html
	> sudo mkdir awesomevicky.com
	> cd awesomevicky.com/
	> sudo nano index.html
	
7# Add below html code in index.html file and save it
	<html>
        <head>
	        <title>AWESOME VICKY SERVER</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <section>
                <h1>Welcome to Environment NGNIX SERVER</h1>
                <p>This is the first example for creating NGINX SERVER</p>
            </section>
        </body>
    </html>

8# Restart the nginx server
    > sudo systemctl restart nginx

9# Still website with domain name will not work since we have not added a DNS entry
    # In windows we have to add an entry in the "host" file for redirecting the website domain to "localhost" web server. It's present inside "c:/windows/system32/driver/etc/"
    > Add entry as below 
        127.0.0.1	awesomevicky.com
        ::1         awesomevicky.com

10# After saving this file go to chrome and hit the domain "awesomevicky.com"

11# Viola..!! Website is working.

12# Follow steps from 4 to 10 for making a subdomains
    > dev.awesomevicky.com
    > qa.awesomevicky.com

13# Create a python script that will monitor the domain and subdomain and will print the status every minute on the console
